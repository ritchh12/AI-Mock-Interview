## 🔍 **Feedback Quality Examples**

### **Before (Generic):**
```
"Your answer was quite brief. Consider providing more detailed explanations and specific examples to better demonstrate your knowledge and experience."
```

### **After (Technical Question):**
```
"Your technical answer needs more depth. Consider explaining the concept step-by-step, mentioning specific technologies or methodologies you've used, and providing concrete examples from your experience. When possible, include metrics, percentages, or timeframes to quantify your impact and achievements."

💡 Quick Tips:
• Explain your thought process and mention specific technologies
• Include specific examples and quantify your impact when possible
```

### **After (Behavioral Question):**
```
"Behavioral questions require specific examples. Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your response. Describe a real situation, what you did, and what the outcome was. Remember to include specific examples from your experience to make your answers more credible and memorable."

💡 Quick Tips:
• Use the STAR method: Situation → Task → Action → Result
• Include specific examples and quantify your impact when possible
```
