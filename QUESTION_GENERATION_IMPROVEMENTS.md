# Testing Enhanced Question Generation

The application now has an improved question generation system that addresses the issue of same questions appearing every time.

## Key Improvements Made:

### 1. Enhanced Question Pool
- **200+ diverse questions** across different categories
- **Job-role specific questions** for Software Engineering, Marketing, Sales, and General roles
- **Difficulty-based timing** adjustments
- **Proper question distribution** (40% technical, 30% behavioral, 20% situational, 10% coding)

### 2. Dynamic Question Selection
- Questions are **randomly shuffled** from large pools
- **Different questions per interview** even for the same role
- **Role-specific technical questions** (e.g., software questions for developers, marketing questions for marketers)
- **Difficulty scaling** for question complexity and time limits

### 3. Fallback System
- **Enhanced fallback** when OpenAI API is not configured
- **Intelligent question mixing** based on job requirements
- **No more static question sets**

## Question Pools by Category:

### Behavioral (12 questions)
- Personal background and motivation
- Strengths, weaknesses, and self-awareness
- Team collaboration and conflict resolution
- Career goals and work preferences

### Situational (12 questions)
- Problem-solving scenarios
- Adaptability and learning
- Decision-making under pressure
- Leadership and influence situations

### Technical (Role-specific)
- **Software Engineering**: Programming concepts, databases, debugging, security
- **Marketing**: Campaign measurement, customer segmentation, analytics, trends
- **Sales**: Lead qualification, pipeline management, objection handling
- **General**: Industry trends, tools, best practices, collaboration

### Coding (10 questions)
- Algorithm challenges
- Data structure problems
- Code quality and validation
- System design basics

## How It Works Now:

1. **Job Role Detection**: System analyzes the job role input
2. **Question Pool Selection**: Chooses appropriate technical questions for the role
3. **Random Shuffling**: Randomly selects from large question pools
4. **Mix Generation**: Creates proper distribution of question types
5. **Final Shuffle**: Randomizes the order of selected questions

## Testing Different Scenarios:

Try creating interviews with:
- **Different job roles**: "Software Engineer", "Marketing Manager", "Sales Representative"
- **Different difficulties**: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced
- **Different question counts**: 5, 10, 15 questions

Each interview should now have unique, relevant questions!

## Benefits:

✅ **No more repetitive questions**
✅ **Job-role specific content**
✅ **Difficulty-appropriate challenges**
✅ **Proper question variety**
✅ **Works without OpenAI API**
✅ **Consistent interview quality**
