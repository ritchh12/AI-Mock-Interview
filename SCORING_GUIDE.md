# AI Mock Interview App - Scoring System

## Overview
This app uses AI-powered evaluation to score interview responses and provide feedback. The scoring system has built-in fallbacks to ensure users always receive scores, even if AI services are unavailable.

## How Scoring Works

### 1. AI-Powered Scoring (Primary Method)
- Uses OpenAI's GPT model to evaluate answers
- Provides scores on a 1-10 scale
- Generates detailed, personalized feedback
- Considers question type, expected answers, and response quality

### 2. Fallback Scoring (Backup Method)
- Activates when AI services are unavailable or not configured
- Provides basic scoring based on:
  - Answer length and completeness
  - Question type difficulty
  - Response structure
- Ensures users always receive feedback

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```
CONVEX_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
CONVEX_OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
```

### Without AI Configuration
- App will use fallback scoring automatically
- Users will still receive scores and basic feedback
- Performance is not degraded

## Troubleshooting

### "N/A" Scores Issue
If you see "N/A" instead of scores:

1. **Check Configuration**: Ensure OpenAI API key is set in environment variables
2. **Use Retry Button**: Click "Regenerate Scores" on the results page
3. **Wait for Processing**: AI evaluation runs asynchronously - wait a few moments
4. **Refresh Page**: Scores update automatically, refresh to see latest results

### Manual Score Regeneration
- Available on the results page when scores are missing
- Retries evaluation for all unanswered questions
- Regenerates overall feedback

## Technical Details

### Scoring Flow
1. User submits answer â†’ Response saved immediately
2. AI evaluation scheduled (runs in background)
3. Score and feedback saved to database
4. Results page displays updated scores
5. Overall feedback generated after all questions

### Error Handling
- Failed AI calls trigger fallback scoring
- Network issues don't prevent score generation
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation ensures user experience

## Score Calculation

### AI Scoring Criteria
- Technical accuracy and depth
- Communication clarity
- Problem-solving approach
- Relevant examples and experience
- Question-specific requirements

### Fallback Scoring Logic
- 1-3: No answer or very brief response
- 4-5: Basic answer with minimal detail
- 6-7: Good answer with adequate detail
- 8-10: Comprehensive answer with examples

## Support
If you continue to experience scoring issues:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify Convex deployment is active
3. Ensure environment variables are properly set
4. Use the retry functionality on results page
